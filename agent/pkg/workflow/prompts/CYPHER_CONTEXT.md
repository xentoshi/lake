# Graph Database Context (Neo4j)

This document contains Cypher query patterns and guidance for the DZ network graph database.

## When to Use Graph Queries

Use `execute_cypher` for things SQL cannot do efficiently:
- **Path finding**: "What's the path between device A and device B?"
- **Latency between metros**: "What's the latency between NYC and TYO?" - always use Cypher first to find the path and sum link RTTs, since SQL only has directly-connected metro pairs
- **Reachability analysis**: "What devices are reachable from metro X?"
- **Impact analysis**: "What's affected if device X goes down?"
- **Multi-hop connectivity**: "What devices are N hops from X?"
- **Network traversal**: "Show the route between these points"

Use `execute_sql` for:
- Listing entities (devices, links, metros)
- Time-series data and metrics
- Validator performance and stake data
- Historical analysis and aggregations

## Combining Tools

Some questions benefit from both tools:
1. Use Cypher to find topology structure (e.g., devices in a path)
2. Use SQL to get performance metrics for those devices

Example: "What's the latency on the path from NYC to LON?"
1. `execute_cypher`: Find the path and links between NYC and LON metros
2. `execute_sql`: Query latency metrics for those specific links

## Graph Model

### Node Labels

**Device**: Network devices (routers, switches)
- `pk` (string): Primary key
- `code` (string): Human-readable device code (e.g., "nyc-dzd1")
- `status` (string): "active", "pending", "drained", etc.
- `device_type` (string): Type of device
- `public_ip` (string): Public IP address
- `isis_system_id` (string): ISIS system ID
- `isis_router_id` (string): ISIS router ID

**Link**: Network connections between devices
- `pk` (string): Primary key
- `code` (string): Link code (e.g., "nyc-lon-1")
- `status` (string): "activated", "soft-drained", etc.
- `committed_rtt_ns` (int): Committed RTT in nanoseconds
- `bandwidth` (int): Bandwidth in bps
- `isis_delay_override_ns` (int): ISIS delay override (>0 indicates drained)

**Metro**: Geographic locations
- `pk` (string): Primary key
- `code` (string): Metro code (e.g., "nyc", "lon")
- `name` (string): Full name

### Relationships

- `(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]->(:Device)`: Links connect to devices (direction is Link→Device)
  - `side` (string): "A" or "Z" indicating which end of the link
  - `iface_name` (string): Interface name on the device
  - **Note**: Each Link has exactly two CONNECTS relationships, one to each endpoint device
  - **Important**: Use undirected pattern `(:Device)-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)` for traversal queries
- `(:Device)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Metro)`: Device location
- `(:Device)-[:OPERATES]->(:Contributor)`: Device operator
- `(:Link)-[:OWNED_BY]->(:Contributor)`: Link owner
- `(:Device)-[:ISIS_ADJACENT]->(:Device)`: ISIS control plane adjacency
  - `metric` (int): ISIS metric
  - `neighbor_addr` (string): Neighbor address
  - `adj_sids` (list): Adjacency SIDs

## CRITICAL: Always Look Up Device Codes First

**Device codes are NOT predictable.** You cannot construct a device code from a metro code. There is no guaranteed pattern like `{metro}-dzd1`.

When a user asks about "the Hong Kong device" or "devices in Tokyo":
1. **First query for devices in that metro** to get actual device codes
2. **Then use those real codes** in subsequent queries

**WRONG - guessing device codes:**
```cypher
// User asks: "What's connected to the Hong Kong device?"
// WRONG: Guessing that hkg-dzd1 exists
MATCH (d:Device {code: 'hkg-dzd1'})-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(neighbor:Device)
RETURN neighbor.code
```

**CORRECT - look up devices first:**
```cypher
// Step 1: Find devices in Hong Kong
MATCH (m:Metro {code: 'hkg'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(d:Device)
RETURN d.code AS device_code, d.status
// Results might show: hkg-dzd2, hkg-dzd3 (NOT hkg-dzd1!)

// Step 2: Use actual device codes from step 1
MATCH (d:Device {code: 'hkg-dzd2'})-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(neighbor:Device)
RETURN neighbor.code
```

**Key rules:**
- A metro may have zero, one, or multiple devices
- Device codes do not follow a predictable numbering scheme
- NEVER assume a device exists - always verify with a lookup query first
- If a lookup returns no devices, report "no devices found in that metro"

## CRITICAL: Hop Count Definition

A "hop" is one link traversal between two devices. In the graph model, a single hop is the pattern `(Device)-[:CONNECTS]-(Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(Device)`, which contains **2 CONNECTS edges** but represents **1 hop**.

- `length(path)` returns the number of CONNECTS edges, NOT hops
- **1 hop** (direct link) = `length(path)` of 2
- **2 hops** (one intermediate device) = `length(path)` of 4
- **N hops** = `length(path)` of 2*N

**Always convert:** `length(path) / 2` to get the actual hop count.

When reporting to the user:
- A direct link between two devices is **1 hop**, not 2
- Use "direct link" or "1 hop" for directly connected devices
- If `length(path)` = 2, say "1 hop (direct link)"
- If `length(path)` = 4, say "2 hops (1 intermediate device)"

## Common Cypher Patterns

### Find Shortest Path Between Devices
```cypher
MATCH (a:Device {code: 'nyc-dzd1'}), (b:Device {code: 'lon-dzd1'})
MATCH path = shortestPath((a)-[:CONNECTS*]-(b))
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) |
  CASE WHEN n:Device THEN {type: 'device', code: n.code, status: n.status}
       WHEN n:Link THEN {type: 'link', code: n.code, status: n.status}
  END
] AS segments
```

### Find Shortest Path Between Metros (by hop count)

**CRITICAL:** When finding paths between metros (not specific devices), you MUST use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1`. This is because metros have multiple devices, so `shortestPath()` returns one path per device pair. Without ordering and limiting, you get multiple arbitrary paths instead of the true shortest.

```cypher
MATCH (ma:Metro {code: 'nyc'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(da:Device)
MATCH (mz:Metro {code: 'lon'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(dz:Device)
MATCH path = shortestPath((da)-[:CONNECTS*]-(dz))
WITH path, length(path) AS pathLength
ORDER BY pathLength
LIMIT 1
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) |
  CASE WHEN n:Device THEN {type: 'device', code: n.code, status: n.status}
       WHEN n:Link THEN {type: 'link', code: n.code, status: n.status}
  END
] AS segments,
pathLength / 2 AS hops
```

### Find Lowest-Latency Path Between Metros

Same as above, but order by total latency first, with hop count as tiebreaker.

```cypher
MATCH (ma:Metro {code: 'nyc'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(da:Device)
MATCH (mz:Metro {code: 'lon'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(dz:Device)
MATCH path = shortestPath((da)-[:CONNECTS*]-(dz))
WITH path,
     length(path) AS pathLength,
     reduce(totalRtt = 0, n IN nodes(path) |
       CASE WHEN n:Link THEN totalRtt + coalesce(n.committed_rtt_ns, 0) ELSE totalRtt END
     ) AS totalRttNs
ORDER BY totalRttNs, pathLength
LIMIT 1
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) |
  CASE WHEN n:Device THEN {type: 'device', code: n.code, status: n.status}
       WHEN n:Link THEN {type: 'link', code: n.code, committed_rtt_ms: n.committed_rtt_ns / 1000000.0}
  END
] AS segments,
pathLength / 2 AS hops,
totalRttNs / 1000000.0 AS total_rtt_ms
```

**Key points for metro-to-metro paths:**
- **ALWAYS use `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1`** for metro-to-metro queries
- Order by `pathLength` for shortest path, or `totalRttNs, pathLength` for lowest latency
- Use `reduce()` to sum `committed_rtt_ns` from Link nodes when latency matters
- Without ORDER BY/LIMIT, you get multiple paths from different device pairs

### Find ALL Paths Between Metros

When the user asks for "paths" (plural), "all paths", or "confirm the paths", use `allShortestPaths()` to find all paths of the same shortest length:

```cypher
// Find ALL shortest paths (same length) between metros
MATCH (ma:Metro {code: 'sin'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(da:Device)
MATCH (mz:Metro {code: 'tyo'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(dz:Device)
MATCH path = allShortestPaths((da)-[:CONNECTS*]-(dz))
RETURN DISTINCT [n IN nodes(path) |
  CASE WHEN n:Device THEN {type: 'device', code: n.code}
       WHEN n:Link THEN {type: 'link', code: n.code}
  END
] AS segments,
length(path) / 2 AS hops
ORDER BY hops
```

**When to use which:**
- `shortestPath()` with `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1` - Returns THE shortest path among all device pairs (use for metro-to-metro "shortest path")
- `shortestPath()` without ORDER BY - Only for device-to-device queries where there's exactly one pair
- `allShortestPaths()` - Returns ALL paths of the shortest length (use for "paths", "all paths", "confirm paths")

**WRONG:** Using `shortestPath()` when user asks for "paths" (plural) - only returns one path.

### Compare Shortest Paths Across Multiple Metro Pairs

When analyzing shortest paths between many metros (e.g., "which metros are closest/farthest?"):

```cypher
// Find shortest path length between each metro pair
MATCH (ma:Metro)<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(da:Device)
MATCH (mz:Metro)<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(dz:Device)
WHERE ma <> mz
MATCH path = shortestPath((da)-[:CONNECTS*]-(dz))
WITH ma.code AS from_metro, mz.code AS to_metro, min(length(path)) / 2 AS min_hops
RETURN from_metro, to_metro, min_hops
ORDER BY min_hops DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Key points:**
- Match metro→device relationships BEFORE the shortestPath
- Use `min(length(path))` to get the shortest among all device pairs between two metros
- The `shortestPath()` pattern contains ONLY the `CONNECTS` relationship

### Find Devices in a Metro
```cypher
MATCH (m:Metro {code: 'nyc'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(d:Device)
WHERE d.status = 'active'
RETURN d.code AS device_code, d.device_type, d.status
```

### Find Reachable Devices from a Metro
```cypher
MATCH (m:Metro {code: 'nyc'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(start:Device)
WHERE start.status = 'active'
OPTIONAL MATCH path = (start)-[:CONNECTS*1..10]-(other:Device)
WHERE other.status = 'active'
  AND ALL(n IN nodes(path) WHERE (n:Device) OR (n:Link AND n.status = 'activated'))
WITH DISTINCT coalesce(other, start) AS device
RETURN device.code AS device_code, device.status
```

### Find Network Around a Device (N hops)

**Remember:** N hops = 2*N CONNECTS edges. Use `[:CONNECTS*1..2]` for 1 hop, `[:CONNECTS*1..4]` for 2 hops, etc.

```cypher
// 1-hop neighborhood (directly connected devices)
MATCH (center:Device {code: 'nyc-dzd1'})
OPTIONAL MATCH path = (center)-[:CONNECTS*1..2]-(neighbor)
WITH collect(path) AS paths, center
UNWIND CASE WHEN size(paths) = 0 THEN [null] ELSE paths END AS p
WITH DISTINCT CASE WHEN p IS NULL THEN center ELSE nodes(p) END AS nodeList
UNWIND nodeList AS n
WITH DISTINCT n WHERE n IS NOT NULL
RETURN
  CASE WHEN n:Device THEN 'device' ELSE 'link' END AS node_type,
  n.code AS code,
  n.status AS status
```

### Find ISIS Adjacencies for a Device
```cypher
MATCH (from:Device {code: 'nyc-dzd1'})-[r:ISIS_ADJACENT]->(to:Device)
RETURN from.code AS from_device, to.code AS to_device,
       r.metric AS isis_metric, r.neighbor_addr
```

### Impact Analysis: Find Devices That Lose Connectivity

**CRITICAL: When checking alternate paths, you must exclude paths that go THROUGH the failed device using NONE() on intermediate nodes.**

**Step 1: Find devices directly connected to the target**
```cypher
MATCH (target:Device {code: 'hkg-dzd1'})-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(neighbor:Device)
RETURN DISTINCT neighbor.code AS connected_device
```

**Step 2: Check which devices have alternate paths NOT going through the target**
```cypher
// For each device connected to target, check if it can reach ANY other device
// via a path that does NOT include the target device
MATCH (target:Device {code: 'hkg-dzd1'})
MATCH (candidate:Device)-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(target)
WHERE candidate <> target
// Try to find an alternate path from candidate to any other device
OPTIONAL MATCH path = (candidate)-[:CONNECTS*1..10]-(other:Device)
WHERE other <> target
  AND other <> candidate
  AND NONE(n IN nodes(path) WHERE n:Device AND n.code = target.code)  // <-- CRITICAL: exclude paths through target
WITH candidate, count(DISTINCT other) AS reachable_without_target
RETURN candidate.code AS device,
       CASE WHEN reachable_without_target > 0 THEN 'connected' ELSE 'isolated' END AS status
```

**Step 3: Simpler check - does device have any direct connection besides target?**
```cypher
MATCH (target:Device {code: 'hkg-dzd1'})
MATCH (candidate:Device)-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(target)
WHERE candidate <> target
// Count non-target neighbors
OPTIONAL MATCH (candidate)-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(other:Device)
WHERE other <> target AND other <> candidate
WITH candidate, count(DISTINCT other) AS other_neighbors
RETURN candidate.code AS device,
       CASE WHEN other_neighbors = 0 THEN 'ISOLATED' ELSE 'has_redundancy' END AS status
```

**Key insight:**
- Use `NONE(n IN nodes(path) WHERE n:Device AND n.code = 'target-code')` to exclude paths through the target
- A device is ISOLATED if it has ZERO connections to non-target devices
- Don't just filter the destination - filter ALL intermediate nodes in the path

### Find Drained Links
```cypher
MATCH (l:Link)
WHERE l.isis_delay_override_ns > 0 OR l.status IN ['soft-drained', 'hard-drained']
RETURN l.code AS link_code, l.status,
       l.isis_delay_override_ns > 0 AS is_isis_drained
```

### Links Between Two Metros
```cypher
MATCH (ma:Metro {code: 'nyc'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(da:Device)
MATCH (mz:Metro {code: 'lon'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(dz:Device)
MATCH (da)<-[:CONNECTS]-(l:Link)-[:CONNECTS]->(dz)
RETURN l.code AS link_code, l.status, l.committed_rtt_ns / 1000000.0 AS rtt_ms
```

## Query Tips

1. **Use lowercase metro codes**: `{code: 'nyc'}` not `{code: 'NYC'}`
2. **Filter by status early**: Add `WHERE status = 'activated'` close to MATCH for efficiency
3. **Limit path depth**: Use `*1..10` not `*` to avoid unbounded traversals
4. **Return structured data**: Use CASE expressions to return clean objects
5. **CONNECTS direction**: Links point TO devices (`(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]->(:Device)`). For traversal, use undirected: `(d1:Device)-[:CONNECTS]-(:Link)-[:CONNECTS]-(d2:Device)`
6. **Do NOT use APOC**: APOC procedures are not available. Use built-in Cypher only.
7. **ALL/ANY syntax**: Use `ALL(x IN list WHERE condition)` NOT `ALL(x IN list | condition)`
8. **shortestPath() single relationship**: `shortestPath()` and `allShortestPaths()` require a pattern with ONE relationship type only. You CANNOT mix relationship types in the path pattern.

**WRONG - multiple relationship types in shortestPath:**
```cypher
// This will FAIL with "shortestPath requires a pattern containing a single relationship"
MATCH path = shortestPath((ma:Metro)<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(d1:Device)-[:CONNECTS*]-(d2:Device)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(mz:Metro))
```

**CORRECT - match metros separately, use single relationship in shortestPath:**
```cypher
MATCH (ma:Metro {code: 'nyc'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(da:Device)
MATCH (mz:Metro {code: 'lon'})<-[:LOCATED_IN]-(dz:Device)
MATCH path = shortestPath((da)-[:CONNECTS*]-(dz))
```

9. **WITH clause variable scope**: Variables from before a WITH clause are NOT accessible after it unless explicitly passed through.

**WRONG - loses `start` variable:**
```cypher
MATCH (start:Device {code: 'nyc-dzd1'})
MATCH path = (start)-[:CONNECTS*1..4]-(other:Device)
WITH DISTINCT other AS device
WHERE device.code <> start.code  // ERROR: start not accessible!
RETURN device.code
```

**CORRECT - carry variables through WITH:**
```cypher
MATCH (start:Device {code: 'nyc-dzd1'})
MATCH path = (start)-[:CONNECTS*1..4]-(other:Device)
WITH DISTINCT other AS device, start  // Carry start through
WHERE device.code <> start.code
RETURN device.code
```

**Alternative - filter before WITH:**
```cypher
MATCH (start:Device {code: 'nyc-dzd1'})
MATCH path = (start)-[:CONNECTS*1..4]-(other:Device)
WHERE other.code <> start.code  // Filter here instead
WITH DISTINCT other AS device
RETURN device.code
```
